# vocabuleasy

A flashcard app built as a term project for CSC690

## Proposal

Vocabuleasy is an app to help language-learners learn vocabulary in their target language in a quick and efficient manner, while minimizing the time it takes to create flashcards by hand.

### Must-have features (with estimates)

    * Reviewing created flashcards (4hrs)
    * Creating new text-based flashcards (2hrs)
    * Creating new flashcards with media (images, sound) (4hrs)
    * Scheduling the review of flashcards with an Spaced-Repetition System (SRS) algorithm (6hrs)
    * Automatic sourcing of pronunciation, example sentences, photos when creating a flashcard (15hrs)

### Nice-to-have features

    * Statistics on the user's learning performance (6hrs)
    * Custom card templates (5hrs)
    * More review schedulers (i.e. cramming) (1hr)
